# Waste-water surveillance 
wastewater COVID-19 surveillance.\\
I write a sample of Rstan for predicting the number of cases for the next week.\\
Data are randomly generated by using randomseed.\\


First, we need to have a time-series:
1.The COVID-19 RNA test from each week
2. The number of cases for each week

# Model Background

We want to use **COVID-19 concentration in wastewater** to predict the **number of cases in the following week**.  
The model can be written as:

$$
\text{Cases}_{t+1} \sim Normal(\alpha + \beta \cdot \text{Wastewater}_t, \; \sigma)
$$



# Components of the Model

## 1. Intercept ($\alpha$)

- **Meaning**: The baseline number of cases, even if wastewater = 0.  
- **Interpretation**: Represents residual infections that exist when no virus is detected in wastewater.  
- **Example**: If $\alpha = 10$, then even with wastewater = 0, the model predicts around 10 cases.  



## 2. Slope ($\beta$)

- **Meaning**: The expected change in cases when wastewater concentration increases by 1 unit.  
- **Interpretation**: Quantifies the association between wastewater signal and case counts.  
- **Example**: If $\beta = 0.8$, then each unit increase in wastewater concentration corresponds to 0.8 more cases on average in the following week.  


## 3. Noise Term ($\sigma$)

- **Meaning**: The standard deviation of random variation around the predicted mean.  
- **Interpretation**: Captures uncertainty and unobserved factors (e.g. rainy day, testing rates, government behavior changes).  
- **Example**: Larger $\sigma$ means predictions are more spread out; smaller $\sigma$ means predictions are more precise.
